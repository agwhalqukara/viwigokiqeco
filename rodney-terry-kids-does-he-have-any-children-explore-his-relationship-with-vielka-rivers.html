However, he has two sons from his girlfriend Vielka’s previous marriage: Prince Elias and Eden Ewing.</strong></p><p>Rodney and Vielka have been in a committed relationship for the past six years. The couple initially shared images of their time in 2018 following a game night. Rodney is not Vielka’s biological father, but he is heavily involved in the lives of her two sons. Rodney Terry was never a player; he was constantly coaching and educating.</p><p>After graduating from St. Edward’s in 1990, he began coaching at the same college. Terry went on to become the first head coach of Somerville High School in Somerville, Texas. As his career developed, he was appointed head coach of the University of Texas El Paso men’s basketball team on March 12, 2018. Terry became Texas’ full-time head coach in 2023.</p><h2>Rodney Terry’s Kids: Does He Have Any With Girlfriend Vielka?</h2><p>Rodney Terry, the head coach, may not have biological children, but he is very close to his girlfriend Vielka’s sons, Eden Samuel Ewing and Prince Elias. One of the boys has already made an impact in the basketball world. Eden Samuel Ewing, born on January 12, 1997, in Richmond, Texas, is making remarkable strides in basketball.</p><p>He stands six feet eight inches tall and plays as a small forward for Fortaleza B.C. in Brazil, having signed in 2023. Eden first showcased his ability as a power forward for Purdue during the 2017-18 NCAA season. He subsequently transferred to Texas Southern University, where he spent the final two seasons.</p><p>In addition to his college career, he has played for the Brazilian basketball team Minas Belo Horizonte. While Eden’s basketball career is extensively documented, information about Vielka’s youngest son, Prince Elias, is more obscure.</p><h2>Rodney Terry’s Girlfriend, Vielka Rivers</h2><p>Rodney Terry, the head coach, has been in a romantic relationship with Vielka Rivers since 2018. Terry regularly posts images of them together on social media, especially on major events like Valentine’s Day and Vielka’s birthday, making their relationship an open book.</p><p>Despite not being married, the couple has a strong relationship and shares their experiences with their social media followers. Vielka, the Texas basketball coach’s girlfriend, is a wealthy entrepreneur. She is the owner of Mercer Salon, a well-known salon that offers outstanding services to consumers.</p><p>Vielka is an excellent designer, model, and educator who also owns her own business.
