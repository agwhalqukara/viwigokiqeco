You ready?” the equestrian responds.</p><p>The 8 Simple Rules alum swings in front of Cook as she bursts out laughing. “This is scary!” she screams between laughs.</p><p>Cook then puts Cuoco over his shoulder and spanks her several times as the couple struggles to perform the challenge.</p><p>“First (of many) MEGA FAIL’s at&nbsp;#thekoalachallenge&nbsp;with my very patient husband&nbsp;@mrtankcook 🤣🤣 I’ve never laughed so hard,” the Hop star captioned the hilarious clip. “It’s a 2 parter so buckle up lol 🐨 please try this at home! Maybe wear a helmet . I now have 3 new injuries but it was worth it.”</p><p>In the next video, the couple are seen successfully pulling off the difficult moves, ending their challenge video with a sweet kiss.</p><p>“After 245 failed attempts we finally did it! LOL the koala challenge is not as easy as it looks,” Cuoco captioned the clip, which showed her sharing a smooch with Cook while he holds her in his arms. “Actually we made it look damn near impossible LOL good luck!! 🐨.”</p><p>The Wedding Ringer star’s celebrity friends couldn’t get enough of the cute videos, leaving several comments cheering on the couple, who <a href=#>wed in June 2018</a> after dating for two years.</p><p>“You two are adorable!!! ♥️♥️♥️,” <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a> wrote on Cuoco’s Instagram, while her Simple Rules co-star <strong>Amy Davidson</strong> commented, “You did it!! 🙌🏻😂💓.”</p><p>“Hahaha DED 😂” <a href=#><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a> wrote underneath their failed challenge video.</p><p>“This is the best thing ever!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,” former Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Ali Fedotowsky</strong></a> said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cuoco recently revealed the coronavirus pandemic “<a href=#>forced</a>” her to move in with her husband nearly two years after the couple said I do. The California native was on location in New York when she was sent back to Los Angeles in March, <a href=#>moving into her and Cook’s new home</a> shortly afterward.</p><p>“This quarantine has actually forced us to move in together,” &nbsp;said during a virtual April 6 appearance on <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;</a>“It’s been great for our relationship. We like each other, we’ve realized, which is even better.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZyaxm6v1KiaqGWjpa6vt8SdZJuxXaCus7iMnKaoo12staq4xGabqKGenHqsu8ClmGabmJa5rbHNoJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glance-at-the-life-of-alicia-borrachero.html><span>←</span><span>Glance At The Life of Alicia Borrachero</span></a>
