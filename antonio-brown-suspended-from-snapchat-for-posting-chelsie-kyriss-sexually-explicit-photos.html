Since his time off the gridiron, he has kept himself busy, creating controversies at ease.</p><p>Whether it be taking digs at <strong>Tom Brady</strong> or his former colleagues, he seems to have done it all in recent times. This time, though, Antonio Brown took things to another level by posting an explicit picture on the social media site, Snapchat.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Antonio Brown allegedly posted a picture of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsie Kyriss</a></strong>, the mother of his four children performing oral sex on him in bed. The picture instantly went viral before it was eventually taken down after users, and Kyriss in particular reported it to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snapchat</a>.</p><p>Following that, it has now emerged that Snapchat has officially suspended Brown’s account from the platform, but not before multiple complaints went in. According to the reputed news outlet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, Snapchat officials claimed that sexually explicit content is prohibited from the platform and an investigation has been launched.</p><p><strong>Read Further:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Pi**ed the team off,” 49ers HC Kyle Shanahan discloses the turnaround time which motivated the team in their DECISIVE playoff win against the Seahawks</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-antonio-brown-s-relationship-with-the-mother-of-his-children-has-gone-downhill-in-recent-months><strong>Antonio Brown’s relationship with the mother of his children has gone downhill in recent months</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Q_1674054678-1024x768.jpg><p>“Very well aware of what’s being posted on snap. I am not in control of his action,” Kyriss wrote on her Instagram story. “I have asked multiple times to have this part of our relationship to remain private but he refuses.”</p><p><a href=#>Chelsie Kyriss</a>, also slammed the former NFL star by posting a brutal message on her Instagram account. She also accused Snapchat of letting Brown post things despite her numerous reports.</p><p>“I have reported his page and all pictures unfortunately Snapchat is allowing his to repost. I am very sorry for any of your kids that follow him and used to look at him as a role model do not condone these actions as you are aware I have kids in involved as well.”</p><p>This is not the first time Antonio Brown has taken his online shenanigans too far in recent times. The 34-year-old has been extremely vocal against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Brady </a>during the quarterback’s divorce from Gisele Bündchen, wherein he even posted explicit images of the Brazilian model.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Antonio Brown’s last appearance on the NFL field came in January last year against the New York Jets. He ripped off his playing gear and shirt, and appeared on the pitch, following which his contract with the Buccaneers was ripped off. Since then, he has channeled most of his energy into creating online controversies, rather than making an effort to get back onto the pitch.</p><p><strong>Do follow us on:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook&nbsp;</a>|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></strong></p><p><strong>Read Further:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“They had us in the first half” – Jaguars fans ECSTATIC after they erase 27-point deficit to complete 3rd largest comeback in playoffs&nbsp;history</a></strong></p><p><strong>Read Further:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brock Purdy earns the respect of NBA icon LeBron James after leading the 49ers to a late-game win against the Seahawks</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMBurc2tpqehn2Kvs7vWp2SsraOlsq%2BwxJ1kn6qfonq0usCpmqGZpGKzsL6MqaasrJmjtG6vx56jrKGVYri6vsisqmarla3CorjLsmSesKChtqS102anoaekpMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-secondhand-smoke-by-kelsea-ballerini.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Secondhand Smoke by Kelsea Ballerini</span></a>
