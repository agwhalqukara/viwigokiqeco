If you have crown moulding, mount the curtain rod right beneath the crown moulding. If the window is less than 6” from the ceiling, and there is no crown moulding, then ceiling mounting the drapes is preferable.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Herein, can you hang curtains within the window frame?</h3><p>Generally, hanging curtain brackets on the wall above and outside the window moulding looks best; it enables cloth to fall smoothly. If you have elaborate window frames you don’t want to cover, an inside mount (hanging curtains inside the frame, as you would with a tension rod) may work.</p><p></p><h3>One may also wonder, where should drapery rods be placed?</h3><p>The higher the curtain rod, the taller the window will look, therefore place your curtain rod closer to the ceiling than the top of your window, if you can. One rule of thumb is that they should sit 4-6 inches above the window frame.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3>In relation to this, how far above window should you hang curtains?</h3><p>Rule 1: Hang Curtains Above the Frame To give the idea of a taller window, install the rod four to six inches above the window frame—or midway between the frame and the ceiling moulding. (But within reason—don’t go more than eight inches over the frame or it can appear weird.)</p><p></p><h3>Are short curtains out of style?</h3><p>Short Curtains Visually speaking, high-water style is not the most beautiful technique to hang curtains. The shorter length might seem antiquated. Also, it might decrease the visible height of your space in half. From a strictly practical sense, though, short curtains are sometimes the best solution.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>34 Related Question Answers Found</h3><h3></h3><h3>Where do you hang drapes with crown moulding?</h3><p>Hang Curtains High Bare minimum: at least 3” to 6” higher than the top of the window, assuming you have that much area to work with.

With the height, if used in combination with a floor length curtain, you may either have the sheer the same length (or just an inch shorter) or merely have the sheers hang down to the sill.</p><p></p><h3>Should curtains match wall colour?</h3><p>Repeat the Wall Color For a color-coordinated effect with patterned curtains, make sure the design has at least a touch of the wall colour.

Vertical Blinds, Wood/Faux Wood Blinds, Cellular Blinds, Venetian Blinds or simply basic shutters are all fantastic alternatives. And to dress them up, add a layer of drapes for that sheer elegance that provides room gallops of attitude.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>How long should sheer curtains be?</h3><p>Floor-length sheers should stop one to two inches above the floor if they are hanging behind another curtain. However, sheers may travel to larger distances if they stand alone.

Insert the café rod or lightweight curtain rod through the end of the sheer curtain. Insert the heavier curtain rod into one end of the drapes.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Do sheer curtains go in front or behind?</h3><p>In days gone by, sheers normally sat closer to the window and the blockout or heavier draperies took pride of place in front. Generally the heavier drapes were the more ornate. This is still appropriate, particularly if the primary fabric is patterned or to be a highlight.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>1</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfo6cmKdlqaTCbrTAp55mm6WnwaK1zaxkqKZdmL%2Bww81mpKiklJ67qHrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-model-hope-howard-shares-one-daughter-with-husband-cody-hook.html><span>←</span><span>American model Hope Howard shares one daughter with husband, Cody Hook</span></a>
