Her academic journey led her to the University of Tennessee, where she pursued a degree in Recreation and Sports Management. In the unpredictable world of Married at First Sight, the experts paired her with 34-year-old pilot Erik Lake, and their union was sealed in the second episode.</p><p>The initial moments of their marriage were filled with compliments and a sense of an “instant connection” between the newlyweds.

In the latest episode, these concerns reached a crescendo. A social media user raised the question: “Have we ever seen Virginia sober? In all seriousness, I really think she might be a functioning alcoholic.” Another fan voiced their opinion, stating, “Virginia is not a good look for the pilot. She doesn’t even carry herself like a woman who is married, and the binge drinking is very unbecoming.”</p><p>The query echoed among fans: “Is it just me, or does Virginia have a drinking problem?” These comments have ignited a broader conversation about the portrayal of individuals on reality television and the responsibility of the show’s creators.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Criticism Towards the Matchmaking Experts</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While viewers express their concerns about Virginia’s drinking, they have also criticized the matchmaking experts behind Married at First Sight. Many fans perceive the pairing of Erik and Virginia as a choice made for the sake of “drama” and “ratings” rather than a genuine connection.</p><p>Dr. Viviana Coles, one of the experts responsible for matching couples on the show, addressed these criticisms in a now-deleted post. She expressed her frustration, deeming the comments “disgusting.” Dr. Coles reminded viewers that the participants on the show are real people, and accusations and assumptions do not reflect genuine concern. She encouraged viewers to wish the couples well and watch their journey, emphasizing the need to avoid mean-spirited and thoughtless commentary.</p><p>As the season of Married at First Sight unfolds, it remains to be seen how Virginia and Erik’s relationship will develop.
