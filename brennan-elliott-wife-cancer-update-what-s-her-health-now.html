Row recently underwent a ‚Äúmass excision‚Äù surgery, which included the removal of her belly button.</p><p>Row was first diagnosed with early-stage gastric cancer in 2018 at age 39. After treatment, which included the surgical removal of her stomach, it seemed the cancer was under control. By 2022, however, the cancer had returned, resulting in her newest round of treatment.</p><p>On June 5, she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">privately updated</a>&nbsp;her followers on her Instagram account, writing: ‚ÄúI have developed a tremendous amount of scar tissue with all of my surgeries. I have a hardened mass behind my bellybutton which has become very uncomfortable. My posture is terrible as I hunch forward and my torso mobility has suffered. So, it will go. And with it my #bellybutton.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhat the mass will come back as is anyone‚Äôs guess,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIt could very well be all scar tissues, cancerous tissue, or a mix of both. Whatever it is, I am happy to be getting rid of it! I am naturally feeling very anxious but I am hopeful that the procedure will be successful.‚Äù</p><p><strong>More</strong>: <a href=#>When Calls The Heart‚Äôs Pascale Hutton Calls Her Husband The ‚ÄòMost Incredible Man In The World‚Äô</a></p><p>After the surgery, Row <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">shared a picture of herself</a> sleeping on a hospital bed, with Elliott at her bedside reading a script ‚Äì he is set to begin shooting a new Hallmark movie this month. In the caption, Row noted she was doing okay overall, but ‚Äústruggling to manage my pain & nausea, unable to eat, and ended up needing a blood transfusion ‚Ä¶ but my surgeon was able to pull it off again so it was all worth it.‚Äù</p><p>She also talked about her husband, sharing that Elliott ‚Äúhas been pulling double duty prepping for a movie & coming to see me daily, making the best of a makeshift office in my hospital room as I nap.‚Äù</p><p>In January, Elliott thanked his followers for their support amid his wife‚Äôs cancer journey.&nbsp; ‚ÄúJust wanted to say tHANKYOU to everyone for your prayers,well wishes and positive thoughts for @camilla_row still waiting on the pathology results but feeling cautiously optimistic! üôè thanx also to the nurses and dr.woo for all they do for patients.

Despite the ongoing cancer struggles, both Row and Elliott have done their best to celebrate life and put their love first as they raise awareness about cancer research and prevention. There isn‚Äôt really a good way to face such a diagnosis and the challenges that come with it, but Row and Elliott have truly become role models for many people going through similar hard times.</p><p><b>For more on Hallmark, check out this gallery on the <a href=# rel=noopener>biggest Hallmark stars‚Äô real-life partners</a>.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2l9eIKOm6mepp6Wu26xy6WgqKykYsSqssRmmpqmk5q%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jonathan-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Who is Jonathan?
