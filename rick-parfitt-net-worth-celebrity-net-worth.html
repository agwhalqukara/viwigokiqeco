Once known as "The Wild Old Man of Rock and Roll," Parfitt suffered a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, and now dubs himself more of a "Mild Man of Rock." Parfitt's most popular guitar is a 1965 white Fender Telecaster, though between both him and Rossi, Status Quo uses 18 guitars while out on the road.</p><p>In 2006, Parfitt released his invention-the "guitar facelift," which provides removable, reusable vinyl covers for guitars. He also has the backing of Fender for Telecaster and Stratocaster Facelifts.
