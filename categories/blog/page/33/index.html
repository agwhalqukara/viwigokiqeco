In another instance of time flying, Keke Palmer’s little boy, Leodis, turned a year old back in February. It feels like it was only six months ago that she was revealing her pregnancy during her SNL monologue! Keke’s had a pretty tough year, but she’s always struck me as a positive person with good vibes in general, and I’m sure she has a strong support structure in place. Keke’s also just become a brand ambassador for Chips Ahoy!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Malu Trevejo Was Forced To Give Up Her Virginity To An Adult Friend By Her Mother</h2><time>Aug 12, 2024</time>

Henry Cavill’s departure from the DCEU last year undoubtedly shocked many people, considering he had finally reprised his most-beloved role in Black Adam earlier. However, with James Gunn now manning the ship, it’s understandable if he wanted to apply his creative takes, including replacing several (or even all) actors!
Enter David Corenswet, one of Hollywood’s up-and-coming actors with an uncanny resemblance to the comic book Superman. After he was officially cast as the new Superman in June 2023, the fans’ opinions were divided, with some still hoping that the DC Studios would keep Henry Cavill to portray the role.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Adios Adidas!
