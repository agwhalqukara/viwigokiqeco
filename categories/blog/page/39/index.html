Answer
Gardena does not resemble a slum in the least. Watts is what the slum is like in Los Angeles, so go there. I would also point out that no area in Los Angeles comes close to the ghetto-ness of areas in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, or Detroit.
Is Gardena, California, a safe place to live? In Gardena, the likelihood of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime is one in every 36 people.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Janet Jackson Reportedly Photoshopped The Glastonbury Festival 2019 Line-Up Poster So That Her Name</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>
