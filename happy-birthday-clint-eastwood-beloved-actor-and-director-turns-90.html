With the Coronavirus pandemic putting a halt on Hollywood, many have wondered what the actor has been up to or if he is slowing down. A devout vegan (many credit his and Betty White’s longevity to the diet), Clint hasn’t shown any signs of retirement but that may soon change. He currently has no projects in the works and his last film was 2019’s, Richard Jewell. Clint has been nominated for 12 Oscars and has won five. His last project, Richard Jewell was also an Oscar-nominated film. At this point, there is no way to know for sure what Clint Eastwood plans to do following the Coronavirus pandemic and Hollywood’s reopening.</p><p>Some of Clint’s most notable films also come with notable lines. He will always be an icon for his role as <span class=see_more_text><span class=see_more_text_collapsed>Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry movies. He began acting in the 50s and started off with many uncredited roles. One of the most famous passages in motion picture history is the following quotation from the 1971 classic Dirty Harry.</span></span></p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, punk. You’re thinking ‘Did he fire six shots or only five?’ Now, to tell you the truth, I’ve forgotten myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and it will blow your head clean off, you’ve gotta ask yourself a question: ‘Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?'”</p><p>With nothing in the works right now, many are worried that Clint Eastwood may finally be ready to retire.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Clint Eastwood (May 31, 1930) <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/7KSgfqxmpu</a></p><p>— Juan Ferrer (@JuanFerrerVila) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 31, 2020</a></p><p>You may see a documentary featuring the life of Clint Eastwood in the video player below.</p><p>https://youtu.be/i63LtuF3ugo</p><p>Do you hope Clint Eastwood continues working?
