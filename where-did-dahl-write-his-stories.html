His service in <b>the RAF</b> influenced his first story collection, Over to You: Ten Stories of Flyers and Flying (1946), a series of military tales that was warmly received by critics but did not sell well.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-roald-dahl-write-his-own-books></span>Did Roald Dahl write his own books?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Who Was Roald Dahl?
