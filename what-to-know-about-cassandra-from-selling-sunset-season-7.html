She tells them she works at Christie's in Los Angeles and is very new to the industry.</p><p>Prior to getting her real estate license, Cassandra was a Playmate for Playboy and worked as an art dealer at a gallery in West Hollywood. Cassandra also has a twin sister Jackie Dawn.</p><p>While modeling for Playboy, it appears that Cassandra actually worked with a member of the Selling Sunset cast, Heather Rae El Moussa, who is also a Playboy alum. Unfortunately, Heather was on maternity leave at the time so she hadn't been in the office and was only briefly featured in Season 7.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Bre Tiesi not like Cassandra?</h2><p>When Cassandra approaches the ladies in Cabo during Season 7, she seems to know a lot of specific details about Bre and insists that she and Bre know each other and used to work together as bottle girls. Cassandra also claimed that Bre previously messaged her asking her to help her promote her fitness app.</p><p>Bre did previously have her own fitness app and runs her own program; however, it's unclear if she actually reached out to Cassandra promote it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Whatever did or didn't happen between Bre and Cassandra, Bre is completely weirded out by her and basically wants to get as far away as possible from Cassandra. Unfortunately, Chelsea is quite keen of Cassandra and keeps inviting her everywhere. She even floats the idea to boss <a href=#>Jason Oppenheim</a> about bringing her onto the team.</p><p>Cassandra, upset with how Bre treated her, bonds with Chelsea with them both claiming that Bre is not warm and friendly like them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Cassandra's husband?</h2><p>Cassandra made it a point of interest to tell everyone that she was married, which is another thing she shares in common with Chelsea. So, who is her husband? Cassandra's husband is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Repstad</a>, the Senior Director of Realty Advisory Group in Los Angeles. Cassandra and John got married in October 2021.</p><p>Unfortunately, Cassandra doesn't share too many photos with her husband John, but we did find a snap of him on her Instagram Story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>John is believed to be at least 15 years older than Cassandra.

While Chelsea was hoping that Jason would bring her on to the team at the Oppenheim Group, he viewed a property that Cassandra was trying to get the listing for and thought she overpriced the home by a few million. Cassandra currently works at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Revel Real Estate</a>, a luxury boutique real estate agency in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK60v8Cnm6uZXZmuuLqMrJylpJmjtG6%2F1Keqnqw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-parfitt-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Rick Parfitt Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
