Most importantly, it introduced audiences to Wayne and his signature rough and tumble guise. After 1939, <a href=#>Britannica</a> writes that he essentially worked non-stop. His next role was in another Ford film, "The Long Voyage Home." Once again, it proved Wayne's acting abilities and his brazen on-screen presence. Based on a play by Eugene O'Neill, the film received several Academy Award nominations. <a href=#>IMDb</a> reports that between 1939 and 1963, Wayne and Ford collaborated on a number of films. As <a href=#>History</a> explains, Wayne, for the most part, always played a similar character.</p><p dir=ltr>He personified a typical cowboy that had tenacity and honor. In addition, Wayne starred in various war films including "Sands of Iwo Jima" in 1949. Some of his other notable films include "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon", "Rio Grande," and "The Searchers." In 1969, his role as Rooster Cogburn in "True Grit" won him his first Academy Award (via John Wayne). Unlike his previous roles, Cogburn was not an average clean-cut cowboy.&nbsp;</p><p>Off-screen, he was heavily involved in conservative politics. <a href=#>History</a>&nbsp;writes that he eventually merged his beliefs and film together. Wayne later directed and starred in "The Alamo" (1960) and "The Green Berets" (1969). Both films reflected his political views. In 1976, he made his final film "The Shootist," as a gunfighter who is dying of cancer. At the time, Wayne was also battling the disease. He died only three years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClWxwcW1fnbKzsdJmrqGnXZ67qbHRoquenF2fvKm6jLCYsqaVqHquu82esGaZlqmys3nHnmSdoZWZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wcvb-meteorologist-david-williams-wiki-and-age-wife-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>WCVB Meteorologist David Williams Wiki And Age | Wife And Net Worth</span></a>
