"He's good. I mean, he is my dad. I'm gonna say he's good," she told CNN. "I guess I'm biased there. Both my parents are really the reason why I do what I do. Them always being so open and playing music around the house. And whenever they saw that I had a passion to do anything artistic, they were always the ones that pushed me."</span></p><p><span>Every time she works on a new album, she says " I'm slowing down a bit. I'm not really because I haven't stopped at all, performing at the Brits to kind of doing a world tour and all the videos that I've done and the places I've traveled. My favorite thing about my job is kind of going back to places and seeing the crowds grow and getting to do something different. And that for me is what really means the most. The music that I love making is pop music, but I want the concepts to maybe be a bit more unconventional. There are so many things that I've been writing about. I just wanna have a lot of fun with it."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/GettyImages-1356280884.jpg><p><span>"Time for a walk with my dog, Dexter. I got really lucky that he and I have the same sleep schedule. If I need to catch a couple extra hours of sleep he's right there with me, but on days when I'm up bright and early, he's ready for his morning walk. Our walks are the perfect way to get my mind right for the day ahead. I usually grab a bottle of Evian ‚Äî gotta stay hydrated ‚Äî and his leash and we head out for a stroll around the neighborhood. While walking, I make a mental list of my intentions for the day," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Refinery29</span></a><span>.</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/GettyImages-1395041555.jpg><p><span>"If you're unsure of what self-care activity is right for you, Kristin Lothman, a mind-body counselor with Mayo Clinic's </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Department of Integrative Medicine and Health</span></a><span> says there are many to try," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>.

"Nobody leaves their country by choice most of the time. And I think it's really upsetting, especially with the refugee situation, because I know how lucky I am to have been, to have lived in the UK and to have been given all these opportunities and to have had the opportunity to come back and live in London and pursue my dream," she told CNN when rhetoric against immigrants seemed like it was at an all time high. "And to think that young kids don't actually have, or may not have that opportunity in the future is really upsetting."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkna2RYrmqvMBmoKdlkpbBqbXNoGSsrZmperSt2KxkoZmgpcZugY%2Btn2aamafBqbDAsmStp12ivK57</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./playboi-carti-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-girlfriend-dating-bio-wiki.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Playboi Carti Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
