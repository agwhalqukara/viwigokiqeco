This will cause the Metal Ball to bounce right on time and pound the targeting device.

An alternative to this is to time the bounce again, but that might be harder. In either case, a treasure chest with five <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bomb Flowers</a> awaits on top. Once that’s out of the way, glide to the shrine’s exit to grab your Light of Blessing.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.

Her passion for games dates to 2006, when she mounted a Chocobo for the first time.
