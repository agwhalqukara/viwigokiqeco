When Jon Hamm was just two years old, his parents divorced. Jon Hamm lived with his mother until she passed away when he was only ten. Following this tragedy, Jon Hamm moved to Normandy, Missouri to live with his father and his grandmother.</p><p>Jon Hamm became involved in acting as early as the first grade, although by high school he still viewed it as a pastime rather than a legitimate future career path. During this time, Hamm became a member of the football, baseball, and swim teams. Not long after Jon Hamm graduated from high school, his father passed away.</p><p>Jon Hamm attended the University of Texas and faced criminal charges after a hazing incident in a fraternity.

After two years, he decided that he wanted a more substantial career and relocated to Los Angeles in an effort to become a professional actor.</p><p>Jon Hamm did not have an easy start in Los Angeles. He drove to the city with just $150 and a car to his name. After moving in with a house filled with other aspiring actors, Hamm worked as a waiter while auditioning for various roles. After three years, he had failed to book a single role and was released by his agency. He continued to work as a waiter, and at a certain point he set a new goal: become an established actor by the age of 30 or quit and go home.</p><p>Not long after making this promise to himself, Jon Hamm started booking roles. In the year 2000, Hamm appeared in NBC's Providence in a guest appearance that grew into a 19-episode recurring role. This led to his first film role in Space Cowboys. By 2001, Hamm was booking major roles in films such as Kissing Jessica Stein and We Were Soldiers. During this period, he continued to appear in television series such as The Division, CSI: Miami, Numb3rs, and The Sarah Silverman Program.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-163662 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Jon-Hamm.jpg alt="Jon Hamm Net Worth" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-163662 class=wp-caption-text>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images</p><h2 id=mad-men><strong>Mad Men</strong></h2><p>While Jon Hamm was an established actor by this point, his true breakthrough came in 2007 when he was cast as Don Draper in Mad Men.

When NBC finally settled on Jon Hamm for the role after numerous auditions, he quickly became an international star.</p><p>In Mad Men, Jon Hamm plays an advertising executive during the 1960s.

Mad Men quickly became a very popular show and debuted with an audience of 1.7 million. Jon Hamm won considerable praise from critics and received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in 2008. Around the time Mad Men concluded in 2015, Jon Hamm finally won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series after being nominated for the award 12 times during the series' run.</p><h2 id=other-acting-work><strong>Other Acting Work</strong></h2><p>While Mad Men was still airing, Jon Hamm kept busy with various film roles.

Typically a high-profile actor like Hamm does not earn a salary per commercial with a brand like Mercedes. He will sign a long-term contract that covers a set number of commercials per year. Based on comparable actor's known endorsement contracts, Hamm is likely operating under a 5-year $15-25 million deal to work with Mercedes. That's $3-5 million per year if you want to think of it that way. But the money is likely paid upfront.</p><p>Hamm has also done endorsements for H&R Block and American Airlines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLewuoyhmKalXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-van-gaal-wheelchair-bound-and-seriously-ill-plotted-netherlands-world-cup-campaign.html><span>←</span><span>How Van Gaal, wheelchair-bound and seriously ill, plotted Netherlands World Cup campaign</span></a>
