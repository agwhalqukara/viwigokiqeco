(Otherwise, Martin says they would have looked like a “Halloween costume” on Butler).</p><p>Instead, they were customized to Butler’s physiognomy, with minor tweaks to their features to make them camera-ready.</p><p>The first? “He wears their sunglasses one when he’s on the Hollywood sign chatting about the rebooting of his career and the ’68 Comeback Special: black, rectangular frames that she says were “hotly contested” on set.</p><p>“People, including Baz Luhrmann, my husband, eyed off those sunglasses and possibly were a little light-fingered with one of the pairs,” she admits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Elvis-Presleys-Iconic-Sunglasses-Inspired-Those-Seen-in-Baz-Luhrmanns-Biopic4.jpg><p>One challenge with dark frames of this kind was ensuring you could see Butler’s expression while maintaining the historical accuracy of the sunglasses. “We had so many different lenses made in a number of</p><p>different colors because on camera, you really want to understand what the actor is thinking and feeling,” she explains.</p><p>And, of course, there are his iconic custom aviators, featuring his initials in the center and “TCB” inscribed on the arms, which he wore from “the very, very late sixties through the seventies, says Martin.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Elvis-Presleys-Iconic-Sunglasses-Inspired-Those-Seen-in-Baz-Luhrmanns-Biopic2.jpg><p>“We made very subtle changes to the way that they were originally designed in order for the initials to be legible on-screen,” she continued. “When they were photographed. In reality, they were a shiny, chrome finish, but we made them have a rougher texture so that when you photographed it, you could actually read the ‘EP’ initial.”</p><p>“We wanted Elvis’s style to be respected and for it to be an interpretation, not an imitation,” says Martin. It’s safe to say that she and the team nailed it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6jCr7PLmqqsnaNitq95xKWtoqtdnru1sdGvoJ6vXay2tbSMnKasrKWism6wxKygoKaVp3qkrdOhnKuhnpp6rq3RraCnZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sasho-cirovski-maryland-soccer-coach-has-an-annual-salary-of-573-000.html><span>←</span><span>Sasho Cirovski (Maryland Soccer Coach ) Has An Annual Salary Of $573,000</span></a>
