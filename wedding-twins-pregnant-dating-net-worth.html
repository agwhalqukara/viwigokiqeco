Her husband became famous for his stand-up comedy act, which made use of his ventriloquism skills through puppetry.</p><h2><span id=The_Net_Worth_of_Audrey_Murdick>The Net Worth of Audrey Murdick</span></h2><p>How rich is Audrey Murdick? As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is close to $1 million, earned largely through a successful career in fitness. Her wealth has also been elevated thanks to the success of her husband, who has a net worth estimated at over $60 million. As she continues her career, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Career>Early Life and Career</span></h2><p>Very little information is available about Audrey’s childhood and her family. It is known that she grew up with her parents, though no details about any siblings have been shared. As a teenager, she discovered her passion for fitness partly to combat weight problems she was experiencing, which resulted in her trying to eat healthy, and look for other ways to help her reduce her weight, such as yoga and spin lessons. However, this was not enough, and she then discovered bodybuilding as a means of helping her attain the weight and physical image she wanted. Concurrently, she discovered that nutrition had a big part in developing the body and her interests went there as well, working with a personal trainer, and eventually entering bodybuilding competitions. Her fame increased over the next few years – she also studied nutrition which led her becoming a certified nutritionist, and her experience in bodybuilding led her to work as a personal trainer. Aside from her fame in the fitness industry, her popularity increased even further through her association with Jeff Dunham. She’s subsequently featured in a few specials, and has also appeared in support roles in movies.</p><h2><span id=Husband_Jeff_Dunham>Husband – Jeff Dunham</span></h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Jeff</a> has appeared in numerous television shows, thanks to his ability to blend comedy and ventriloquism, including “The Tonight Show”, “Comedy Central Presents”, and “Late Show with David Letterman”. He’s also created numerous comedy specials, such as “Jeff Dunham’s Very Christmas Special”, “Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself”, and “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Jeff Dunham: All Over the Map</a>”. He has been credited with reviving ventriloquism, with his characters being described as politically incorrect and gratuitously insulting.</p><p>He has been voted as America’s favorite comedian, and is the top grossing stand-up in North America, being ranked as the third highest paid comedian behind Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock, as well as one of the most successful acts in Europe. He’s reached high numbers of sales, with more than 350 million hits on the website YouTube. One of his most popular puppets is Achmed the Dead Terrorist, which is a part of one of his most watched videos of all time. He holds the Guinness record for most tickets sold for a stand-up comedy tour when he performed in 386 venues during his “Spark of Insanity” tour. He does occasional acting too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/51itMdhHd7L.jpg><h2><span id=Relationship_and_Marriage>Relationship and Marriage</span></h2><p>Murdick is not Dunham’s first wife – he was first married to Paige Brown in 1994, and they have three children including one child adopted from Paige’s previous relationship. However, time away performing put a strain on their relationship, and he filed for divorce in 2008. The following year he started a relationship with Murdick, which blossomed for the next three years, leading them to become engaged. They <a rel=nofollow href=#>married</a> in 2012 and three years later she gave birth to twin boys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/married.jpg><p>She shares his enthusiasm for comedy and his love for various collections. With their marriage, his collection of muscle cars, apple products, kit helicopters, and ventriloquist dummies were also shared with her. Since their marriage, there have been no rumors of any strain or tension within their relationship; she has been seen supporting her husband in the background during his shows, and has also made a few live appearances herself.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>And so it begins… <a rel=nofollow href=#>#twinpottytraining</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/hT4NIZhDRh</a></p><p>— Jeff Dunham (@jeffdunham) <a rel=nofollow href=#>May 3, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Audrey_Murdick_on_Social_Media_and_Recent_Endeavors>Audrey Murdick on Social Media and Recent Endeavors</span></h2><p>One of the reasons there is very little information available about Audrey’s past and current endeavors is due to a lack of any online presence; she does not have accounts on any of the major social websites. Her husband on the other hand is very active online, which is normal for most stand-up comedians. He has accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and uses them to promote some of his recent and upcoming projects, including video specials, tours and television appearances. He also uses the platform Twitter to express some of his daily thoughts and comedic ideas.</p><p>His photos often consist of him posing with his puppets – Murdick rarely makes any appearance there, with their children often found in more photos than her on Dunham’s account. There are a few pictures of her on the website Instagram, including her posing with the family for Halloween photos. Aside from social media, he also has an account on YouTube, on which he posts videos and shorts to help promote his tours. He also has a personal website which sells tickets, merchandise, and upcoming events. He is featured in other YouTube channels and websites too, thanks to his popularity through his continued work on the comedy circuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunC2xJ%2BdZpylo7WiudJmrqKelWKutrDRnrBmpaWnsaqvymauoqOZYsSmsMOipaBlpKy2r7%2BMqamen56Wu7V5w5qroqaXYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./netflix-confirms-luther-film-in-the-works-and-reveals-amazing-new-cast.html><span>←</span><span>Netflix confirms Luther film in the works and reveals amazing new cast</span></a>
