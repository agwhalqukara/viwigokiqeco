I'm sittin' on the top of Kilimanjaro
All my heart is yearning
Like a candle burning in the night
Seasons keep on turning
Sometimes hard to keep up the fight
I will climb the ancient mountain
I will find the last flicker of the light

I'm sittin' on the top of Kilimanjaro
I can see a new tomorrow
I'm sittin' on the top of Kilimanjaro
I cast aways all my sorrows</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Charles Stewart</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>
