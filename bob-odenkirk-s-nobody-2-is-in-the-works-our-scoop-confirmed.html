Well, it looks like you might just get your wish. Our <a href=#>earlier scoop</a> that Nobody 2 was a go is looking truer by the day, with a recent Instagram post from the producer David Leitch and his production company all but confirming the sequel. Check out the post below:</p><p>That caption doesn’t really beat around the bush. In the photos, you can see plenty of behind-the-scenes photos of Bob Odenkirk, RZA, Christopher Llyod, director Ilya Naishuller, and other contributors to the production of the first movie. The hashtag #NOBODY2 makes it pretty clear that everyone is willing and ready to go on bringing the Nobody universe back to life.</p><p>If you missed Nobody, it was a bit of a sleeper hit last year. It managed to pull in about <a href=#>$55 million worldwide</a> against a $16 million budget, which isn’t too shabby for a brand new R-Rated IP amidst a pandemic. It definitely helped that the movie was met with warm reviews from critics and audiences alike. Nobody starred the normally unassuming Bob Odenkirk as a suburban family man whose true nature is revealed after he’s pushed a little too far. One might not normally think of Odenkirk as a John-Wick style badass, but it’s a role he absolutely pulls off here. All you have to do is watch one of the <a href=#>best fight scenes</a> of the year if you remain unconvinced.</p><p>The last movie certainly left things pretty open for a sequel. We saw Bob Odenkirk’s character and his wife, played by Connie Nielsen, touring a new home after their previous home was destroyed by Russian gangsters. The couple asks if the house has a basement, a wink to the audience about an earlier scene where his family goes to the basement safe room while the house is under attack. It clearly looked like he was ready to go back into his old business of working as a government operative.</p><p>If Nobody 2 is a go, then it’s likely that most of the cast and crew will be returning. Obviously, we’ll be seeing Bob Odenkirk return as Hutch Mansell. Connie Nielsen, Gage Munroe, and Paisley Cadorath would likely be back as his wife and two kids. And surely everyone would love to see the return of Christopher Llyod and RZA as his equally badass Dad and brother. Ilya Naishuller would undoubtedly be on to direct, and writer Derek Kolstad should be back as well.</p><p>While we wait for Nobody 2, you can catch Bob Odenkirk reprising one of his other big roles when the Season 6 premiere of Better Call Saul lands on April 18. The Breaking Bad spinoff features Odenkirk as the lawyer Jimmy McGill, who eventually transforms into the slimy Saul Goodman we were introduced to in the original show. The sixth season of <a href=#>Better Call Saul</a> is the final one, so it’ll be your last chance to see Odenkirk in the critically-acclaimed role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ian5d6sLDEp6Kiqpuoeq%2B7waibsmViYra0ecinZK2glWLEsL7KrGSoraJiwKS7zqlknKeem7azucSdZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-vicki-thorn-founder-of-project-rachel-passed-away.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Vicki Thorn?
